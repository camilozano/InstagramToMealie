## Project Patterns
1. Authentication Handling
   - Prefer session-based authentication for Instagram
   - Always require Mealie API key
   - Support but don't recommend 2FA

2. Configuration Management
   - Use environment variables for all settings
   - Maintain Docker-friendly configuration
   - Provide clear documentation for setup

3. Code Organization
   - Core logic in main.py
   - Helper modules in helpers/
   - Templates in templates/
   - Memory bank in memory-bank/

## Working Patterns
1. Documentation Updates
   - Update memory bank after significant changes
   - Keep progress.md current
   - Document known issues promptly

2. File Operations
   - Use replace_in_file for small changes
   - Use write_to_file for new files
   - Keep file paths relative to project root

3. Development Flow
   - Test with sample Instagram posts
   - Verify Mealie integration
   - Check Docker deployment
   - Update documentation

## Learning Points
1. Project Structure
   - Python-based web application
   - Flask for simplicity
   - Docker for deployment
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. Integration Focus
   - Instagram data extraction
   - Mealie recipe creation
